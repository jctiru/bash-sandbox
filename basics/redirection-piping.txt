Redirection
Every program run on the command line automatically has 3 data streams
-STDIN(0) - Standard input (data provided to program)
-STDOUT(1) - Standard output (what program prints, defaults to terminal)
-STDERR(2) - Standard error (what error msgs program prints, defaults to terminal)

Example
cat in.txt > out.txt
cat in.txt 1> out.txt
cat in.txt 2> errors.txt
cat in.txt 1> out.txt 2> errors.txt
cat in.txt &> out.txt
cat in.txt 1> out.txt 2> &1
> Rewrite
>> Concat

Piping
Sending data from one program to another
cat file.txt | head -5 | tail -3 | wc -l
